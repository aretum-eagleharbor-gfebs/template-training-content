    <p>Lesson 2 is titled GFEBS Overview</p>
    <p>This lesson contains the following sections:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Background and Purpose</li>
      <li>Features and Structure</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It also provides the basis for the inception of GFEBS, details its origin, and analyzes the
      rationale behind its implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we will discuss the rationale behind the implementation of GFEBS by taking a look at
      the Army's legacy financial system environment vs. the GFEBS environment. Then, we will
      compare GFEBS's streamlined structure and improved features to the legacy financial
      information structure.
