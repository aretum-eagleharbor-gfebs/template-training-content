      Welcome to the General Fund Enterprise Business System (GFEBS) Essentials module. In this
      introduction, we provide an overview of the material covered in the module lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GFEBS Essentials learning module provides initial prerequisite training for personnel who
      will perform duties in GFEBS. GFEBS is the Army's web-enabled financial, asset and accounting
      management system. It standardizes, streamlines and shares critical data across the active
      Army, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Although this module does not give
      everyone the tools to perform in every position, it does provide a basic program overview and
      also introduces some tasks required to understand and navigate through GFEBS.
